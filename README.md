## Getting started

### Get Python

Ensure your system has the latest version of Python 3 available for your operating system.
At the time of writing, this is version 3.10 (on the author's system). To install Python 3,
use your operating system's package manager on Unix-type environments, or windows search
and install the Anaconda distribution, since this will come pre-installed with almost
every package you need.


### Install dependencies

Use python's built-in package manger `pip` to install software dependencies.
Depending on your python installation, you may need to type `pip3` instead of `pip`.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Run code

For example,

```bash
python tracer1d.py
```

Again, you might need to type `python3` instead of `python` to avoid invoking python 2.x, on some systems.
